Description: LESYMAP maps the specific brain areas responsible for
    cognitive deficits by taking a series of lesion maps and a vector
    of behavioral scores. Both univariate (t-test, Brunner-Munzel,
    regression) and multivariate (sparse canonical corelations) are
    available. LESYMAP contains functions specific for running and
    assessing simulations studies.
